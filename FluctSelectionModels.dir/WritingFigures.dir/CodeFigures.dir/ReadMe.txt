•  PhenotypePlotCode.R --> Contains the code to make supplemental phenotype figures in SupplementalFigures.qmd files·     
•  PublicationFigures.qmd --> Contains codes used for spectral analysis plots, and other figures in the manuscript·     
•  SupplementalFigures.qmd --> Contains codes used for spectral analysis plots, and other figures in the manuscript
