### Project Notes

### Notes about Slim

How to get output we need:
- phenotype
- allele frequency at every qtl for every generation

How to set up initial genetic variation how we would like?
- use fixed number??
- set effect sizes according to dist?
- mimic what we did already


### June 20

Have most of the simplest model in SLiM - still not in control of initial allele freqs. Maybe this is ok. Need to get output. 

#### June 13

Working on getting the output right for SLiM. Will use some custom Edios.
