## Overall Aims

-   Aim 1: Develop a polygenic evolutionary model that can predict the effects of fluctuating selection, and test the model with an E&R experiment featuring constant and fluctuating selection regimes for thermal stress.
-   Aim 2: Develop a polygenic evolutionary model that can predict the effects of recurrent bottlenecks, and test the model with an E&R experiment featuring stable and fluctuating demographic regimes.

## Key Model Parameters

-   Number of genetic loci
-   Effect sizes of genetic loci
-   Selection gradient
-   Pattern of fluctuating selection
    -   generations
    -   irregular periodicity
    -   size of shift
-   Heritability
-   Population dynamics
    -   generations
    -   irregular periodicity
    -   size of reduction
-   Life history (asexual, sexual, switching)

## Initial starting point

-   Constant & fluctuating selection
-   One set number of loci (100)
-   Different selection strengths (distance between optima, 4 levels of varying strength)
-   Several generation intervals for the shift (3 different intervals 10, 20, 30)
-   Even shift high low (same time interval)

```         
1.  Run above models (by Th 8)
    -   finalize fitness function
    -   choose parameter values for your 12 combos
2.  Analyze & visualize output
    -   spectral analysis approach
    -   genome-wide visuals
```

So far, I have modeled linear and sinuso√Ødal optimum change, but what about modelling stochastic optimum? For example:

-   Following normal, exponential, and uniform distribution. What can we observe if we do that? Allele Freq? Phenotype? Spectral Analysis?
