## Simulation project

Here are the notes taken while working on the yeast simulation model. Most of these notes are based on the code writing and some additional ideas that might come while working on the project.

## Writting Flow

The most current notes are at the top.

I today figured out that .tagF wouldn't work until we scale the fitness. Maybe it might be good to read more about it in the Eidos manual. Also, according to the plots, it seemed like the mutation doesn't change much about the frequency over generation when used a genome from dummy population.ed

Creating an initial genome using a dummy population. In this case we need a sub-population with a single genome that has added mutations and its effect size correspond to the number of QTLs.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(slimr)
slim_block(1, early(),
             {sim.addSubpop("p2", 1);
	g = p2.genomes[0];
	muts = g.addNewMutation(m2, rexp(100), Q);
	
	sim.addSubpop("p1", 10000);
	marks = runif(100, 0,1);
	ind = 0;
	for(qpos in Q)
	{
		for(g in p1.genomes)
		{
			if(rbinom(1,1,marks[ind])==1){g.addMutations(muts[ind]);}
		}
		ind = ind + 1;
	}
	p2.setSubpopulationSize(0);})

```

Have an initial frequency distribution; draw random positions where your mutations could be in the sub-population to use.

During the one on one meeting, we discussed about selection coefficient. I came to realize that our selection is predicated on the **optimum phenotype** not the selection coefficient we set. For fluctuating selection, we will be **changing the optimum phenotype at a given generation interval**.

Also, we talked about the introduction of new mutations. When only one individual carries the mutation (assuming beneficial mutation), that individual will have a high fitness thus higher reproductive priorities. Therefore, the mutation will fix so quickly.
