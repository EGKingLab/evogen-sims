In this folder, we considered a dummy population to have a non-empty genome. That is, our genome, has a somehow fixed mutation in some locations (loci). 

If we want the QTL to be 100, some QTL started with random mutations(Based on the distribution of interest), and then, over generations, there were no new mutations.

The code file in this folder doesn't have the optimum phenotype due to the fitness scaling used.
