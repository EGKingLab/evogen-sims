Here is to increase the selection pressure so that it can be easy to tell the change in selection
The previous models considered 2 standard deviations while the current are for four standard deviations.

Note that the directory CS.dir is focusing on constant selection while considering different parameter
 - Optimum shift (1sd, 2sd, 3sd, 4sd)
 - Generation interval (10, 20, 30 ...)

Heritability remains the same, but I will have to change it later on.
