Here is to increase the selection pressure so that it can be easy to tell the change in selection
The previous models considered 2 standard deviations while the current are for four standard deviations.

Note that the directory CS.dir is focusing on constant selection while considering different parameter
 - Optimum shift (1sd, 2sd, 3sd, 4sd)
 - Generation interval (10, 20, 30 ...)

Heritability remains the same, but I will have to change it later on. 

CF_Sel.dir = Constant and Fluctuating sSelection Folders while considering different fitness function
 CSCP.QTL.slim  FSCP4sd.QTL.slim  FSFP4sd.1.QTL.slim  = These are from tadopted from old model which was considering only 2sd of optimum from mean phenotype, and we wanted to changed the selection strength 
Re RunCSCP_SLiM.sh  RunFSCP2sd_SLiM.sh  RunFSFP_4sd_1_SLiM.sh  <- same as the above

trash.dir = This folder contains mostly old models or files that I didn't want to delete completly.
