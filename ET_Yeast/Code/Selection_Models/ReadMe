> Here is the simulation for constant selection constant population.
> The phenotypes are zcored scaled and there is an addition of a constant 10
> The file "CSCP.QTL.slim has the slim simulation
> RunMySlimSamples.txt has the number of replicates, genome size, and heritability
> RunSlimQTL.sh is bash file that allows to run our simulation on the server
> MyComputerRun.sh helps run the simulation on my personal computer
