> Here is the simulation for constant selection constant population.
> The phenotypes are  scaled by diving the individual pheno with standard deviation and there is an addition of a constant 100 to avoid negative values
> The file "CSCP.QTL.slim has the slim simulation
> RunMySlimSamples.txt has the number of replicates, genome size, and heritability
> RunSlimQTL.sh is bash file that allows to run our simulation on the server
> MyComputerRun.sh helps run the simulation on my personal computeri

> CSCP.QTL.slim = Constant Selection Fluctuating Selection slim code
> FSCP2sd.QTL.slim = Fluctuating Selection in which the optimum is two standard deviation below or above the mean phenotype
> RunCSCP_SLiM.sh = sbatch cppde to run CSCP replicates
